		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
        Greetings!
<br />
Whether it is to win some promos, to get some hard-earned field experience or to have a good fun with friends, Netrunner tournaments are in many communities the place to go. People will suit up, sleeve up their best decks and get ready to fight. Tournaments bring all of us together and generate a lot of discussion. However, one thing I have noticed is that there is very little talk about what goes on during a tournament. Talking about the role of a judge, the floor rules, the various processes, infractions and so on. So I decided to jump ahead and try starting a discussion on such topics which are fundamental to our game, but less sexy than hot tech.
<br />
As for my credentials, I'm a player from the Montréal meta (native french speaker). I've started right at the start of the game and competed in official events since the start, in 2013. I've been a competitive player for all card games I played and I organized my first Magic tournament when I was still a teenager in my dad's garage. As for Netrunner, I've organized events and I've been a judge and marshal up to the regional level. I'm a rule junkie and act as the unofficial judge in Montréal. I read about judging in other competitive games and sports and actually enjoy reading a whole rulebook.
<br />
This series of articles is meant for people who take a keen interest in how Netrunner events are run, in its rules and operational details. Since many people do a much better job at it, I won't be discussing strategy in these articles, focusing rather on the behind the scenes. We'll talk about rulings, rules, infractions and so on. 
<br />
Obviously, I am not an authority on the matter. Fantasy Flight and its employees have the final matter. And maybe eventually a new judge program will make all of this obsolete. But until then, to make sure communities can enjoy well-ran events and consistency, I'll start the discussion.
<br />
Every other week, I will write an article about a topic related to judging and event running, based on events I've participated in. People are highly recommended to chime in with their own experiences. The goal is to reach some kind of unofficial consent on how we, as a community, think that Netrunner can continue to provide great competitive events for players, organizers and judges alike.
<br />
As a teaser, here's a very short list of topics I'd like to delve in. 
<br />
<ul>
<li>Intentional Draw protocol</li>
<li>Game components</li>
<li>Infractions</li>
<li>Results tracking</li>
<li>Scouting</li>
</ul>
<br />
The non-link providing rabbit hole goes very deep, so I imagine there’s a lot of material that will be covered in this series of articles.
And for a first article, we'll discuss about what is our body of work: reference material. I hope you can find inspiration from these articles, since behind every great event, there's an organizer in the shadows!
